Finding a comprehensive open-source database with all longitudes and latitudes in Algeria might be challenging, as such a database would be extremely large and detailed. However, there are several resources and approaches you can consider to get geographical data for Algeria:

OpenStreetMap (OSM):
OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. You can extract data for Algeria from OSM.

GeoNames:
GeoNames.org offers geographical database that covers all countries and contains over eleven million placenames.
GADM data:
GADM provides maps and spatial data for all countries and their sub-divisions. You can download data for Algeria from their website.
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA):
The NGA provides a GEOnet Names Server (GNS) that includes data for Algeria.
Custom data collection:
If you need very specific or detailed data, you might need to compile it yourself using various sources, including official Algerian government resources, if available.

When working with this kind of data, keep in mind:

Data completeness and accuracy can vary.
You may need to process the data to fit your specific needs.
Ensure you comply with the licensing terms of any data you use.
For very detailed data (e.g., every possible coordinate), you might need to generate it programmatically based on Algeria's boundaries.

Would you like more information on how to work with any of these data sources, or do you have a specific use case in mind for the longitude and latitude data?
